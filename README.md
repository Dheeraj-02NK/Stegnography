# Stegnography
Steganography project

# Abstract
Steganography is the art of hiding information within an image, audio, or video file without leaving any visible traces. In this project, we present a novel approach to steganography, where the message is first encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm and then embedded into the least significant bits of the pixels of an image. This technique provides an extra layer of security to the hidden message, making it more difficult to be detected by any unauthorized party. We experimented with different image formats and encryption algorithms to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that our method provides better security and robustness to the steganographic messages while maintaining the quality of the cover image. The proposed method has potential applications in the field of secure communication and data transmission, where it is essential to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

# Conclusion 
In conclusion, the proposed approach of combining encryption and steganography techniques for hiding secret messages in images has been shown to provide a more secure and robust method of communication. By encrypting the message before embedding it into the least significant bits of the pixels of the cover image, the proposed approach provides an extra layer of security to the hidden message, making it more difficult to be detected by unauthorized parties.
